In an effort to fight a sedentary work-life, a few years ago, I decided to pick up [Judo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo). A combat sport, it was guaranteed to get me up and moving and provide a bit of a social element. At least, moving more than playing darts down at the pub and drinking more water than beer. I'd been considering Judo for years but always found one reason or another **not** to start, so I finally figured it was time. 

Founded in 1882 by Jigoro Kano, Judo was based in several traditions of Japanese unarmed fighting (_jujutsu_). Kano wanted to improve safety in the practice of jujutsu, which was plagued with injuries; however, as he progressed with the design of **_what_** Judo was, he made some cuts from some standard jujutsu cirriculum and adding moral and philisophical components. Judo, as a martial art, emphasises throws, pins or holds, strangulation and joint manipulation techniques. He used is influence as an educator to get Judo into the national school cirriculums in Japan, teaching its morals and philisophies within physical education.

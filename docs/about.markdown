This is the professional (and semi-personal website) of Drew Sutton (**dasseclab**). I am a network engineer who is interested in globally dsitributed networks, their technologies and securing those same networks. I've worked across a variety of industries but currently find myself happiest in the Big Tech sector. 

Here is where I blog about networking, network security, information security and other technology subjects. If you're interested in something like a resume or CV, you can find it [here](/CV). You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/drewsutton). I also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/dasseclab) for some of my software projects. You can check my cryptographic profile on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/dasseclab).

I live in Atlanta, USA with my wife, daughters and our cats. When I am not on hanging out on the the Internet, I am typically in a kitchen cooking or grilling (if the season fits) or watching Japanese cartoons. But let's face it, there's plenty of places on the Internet for food and toons.
